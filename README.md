# Ammonium-transporters
Attempting to deduce the evoultion of the Amt/Mep/Rh ammonium transporter family 

Full length sequences obtained from NCBI.

Helix sequences obtained by searching NCBI with the pdb IDs for each known ammonium transport structure

E.coli Amtb 3CIJ,
N.europaea 3B9W,
H.sapiens 3HD6,
S.cerevisiae 5AEX,
Candidatus kuenenia stuttgertiensis 6EU6,
A.fulgidus 2B2I,
C.albicans 5AF1

Then clicking on the structure ID at the top left. This brings you to the PDB site. Click on sequence then view features in 3D and you can use this to get the helix sequence in relation to the protein structure.
